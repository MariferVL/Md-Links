    The user inputs a file path and optional arguments (validate and/or stats) through the command line.
    The CLI (Command Line Interface) reads the input and passes it to the JavaScript API.
    The mdLinks() function in the API receives the file path and optional arguments and starts analyzing the file(s).
    The function extracts all the links in the file(s) and creates an object for each link with its href, text, and file properties.
    If the validate argument is true, the function sends an HTTP request to validate each link's status and adds the status and ok properties to the link object.
    If the stats argument is true, the function calculates and logs the total number of links, the number of unique links, and the number of broken links (if validate is also true).
    The mdLinks() function returns an array of link objects.
    The CLI receives the array of link objects and logs each link's href, text, file, status, and ok (if validate is true).
    The CLI logs the statistics (if stats is true).
    The program ends.
